# BUGS

> Need to find a way to run in "no-log" mode. It's probably sufficient to make all `log()` calls function like `cache()` calls and then make sure all behind-the-sscenes logging (i.e.-variables) is just caching.

<span/>
> Would be nice, during agent handover, to erase the history in the call stack corresponding to all of the hijacking.
